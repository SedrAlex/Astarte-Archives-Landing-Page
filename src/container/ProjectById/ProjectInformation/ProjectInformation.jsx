      In the heart of Duda Timur, there's a hidden gem high up on a hill â€” the sacred Pura Pucak Bukit Pintu temple and Sacred Spring Water, playing a unique role as guardian of villages below and its environmental treasures. These symbols of spiritual purity, where the sacred meets spring waters, currently face limited accessibility as well as an inefficient distribution of spring water during ceremonies. To overcome these challenges we plan to restore and create durable stairways, to build a specialized container for efficient water distribution and to build a place for communities ceremonies. This outdoor space highlights the physical, spiritual and cultural significance that courses through this place's history.

      The objective of this project is to restore and rekindle the sacred Pura Pucak Bukit Pintu temple, nearby the village of Duda Timur, Bali. For generations, Pura Pucak Bukit Pintu has been a place of worship for its local Hindu population of one thousand people. However, the temple is 30 minutes away from the village and accessible only by foot, making it off-bounds for much of the community. As such, significant spiritual ceremonies are not being practiced and risk not being transmitted to the next generation. Quantum Temple aims to restore these ceremonies through a tripartite approach. The first is to connect the community and Pura Pucak Bukit Pintu through building a road, which will in turn facilitate the movement of materials for on-site construction projects. These include the construction of temple platforms, and the restoration of a water spring. This project funds the construction of the road to Pura Pucak Bukit Pintu.
